# bicycle

This package started out as just a few R functions and notes that reproduced the calculations in Chapter 4 of [Lugged Bicycle Frame Construction, 3rd Ed.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492232645?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details) by Marc-Andre R. Chimonas. It allows you to save multiple frame designs and compare any two them as a ggplot object. The main goal of this package is to provide a framework where I can add more functions as the need arises. 

For example, bicycle makers publish geometry tables on their websites for models that they have in production. These tables have some useful dimensions -- seat tube length, head tube angle, fork rake, etc. -- but they do not show everything that you need to sketch out the frame and compare it to another. It would be nice to have some functions on hand that can derive what's missing from what's available.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bicycle from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ghuiber/bicycle")
```

## Example

Here's a simple way to derive the bottom bracket drop from some frame dimensions:

```{r example}
library(bicycle)
get_bb_drop(60, 72, 430, 10)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
